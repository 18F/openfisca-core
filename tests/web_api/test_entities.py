Household is an example of a group entity.
A group entity contains one or more individualÂ·s.
Each individual in a group entity has a role (e.g. parent or children). Some roles can only be held by a limited number of individuals (e.g. a 'first_parent' can only be held by one individual), while others can have an unlimited number of individuals (e.g. 'children').

Example:
Housing variables (e.g. housing_tax') are usually defined for a group entity such as 'Household'.

Usage:
Check the number of individuals of a specific role (e.g. check if there is a 'second_parent' with household.nb_persons(Household.SECOND_PARENT)).
Calculate a variable applied to each individual of the group entity (e.g. calculate the 'salary' of each member of the 'Household' with salaries = household.members('salary', period = MONTH); sum_salaries = household.sum(salaries)).
