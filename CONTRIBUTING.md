## Common guidelines for all OpenFisca modules

[Common contributor guidelines](https://doc.openfisca.fr/contribute/guidelines.html).


## Peer reviews

All pull requests must be reviewed by someone else than their original author.

> In case of a lack of available reviewers, one may review oneself, but only after at least 24 hours have passed without working on the code to review.

To help reviewers, make sure to add to your PR a **clear text explanation** of your changes.

In case of breaking changes, you **must** give details about what features were deprecated.

> You must also provide guidelines to help users adapt their code to be compatible with the new version of the package.
